#A Statistical-Mechanical Analysis of the Hopfield Network

This repository contains code used to create plots in the paper I wrote for my Statistical Mechanics class at Stanford, Autumn 2024. Here I reproduced key theoretical results regarding the Hopfield Network, namely its free energy and its stable states at thermodynamic limits. These calculations inform us of the theoretical limits of the network's performance.
